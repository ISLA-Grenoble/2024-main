This is the main page to look for materials of our classes on "Introduction to 
statistical learning and applications" in 2024. Please note that we **won't be using Chamilo**, 
so you should be checking this page regularly for updates.

### Textbooks
- Our course has an official booklet available [here](https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/iTtXPTdLpyMwBtN).
    - **Important**: Please note that although this is the “official” booklet, the materials covered in class are not entirely included in it. Also, I won’t be presenting everything that is written in the booklet. Conclusion: to be sure of what I’ve given in class, you should always come to classes! (and take a look at the slides)
- Many examples and explanations given in class were inspired (or unashamedly copied) from Cosma Shalizi’s excellent lecture notes *“The truth about linear regression”* available [here](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/TALR/).
- Students should also consider reading some chapters from James et al. (2022) *"Introduction to statistical learning with applications to R"* which is freely (and legally) available [here](https://www.statlearning.com/).
- Another excellent reference is Hastie et al. (2017) *"Elements of Statistical Learning"* which is freely (and legally) available [here](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/).

### Grading
Your final grade will the average of your TP scores (50%) and the final exam (50%)

#### -- Concerning the TP scores
You will be doing five TPs during this class and your final TP score will be based on the average score of your four best reports. Please be sure to do your reports properly and nicely, always including your `rmd` file in your final submission so your professors can rerun your experiments and code. You should always include the name of all students from your group in your final report. The reports (both `rmd` and `html` files) should be delivered as a `zip` file on [Teide](https://teide.ensimag.fr/). If no one in your team has access to it, then you can send your report by e-mail to [Pedro](mailto:pedro.rodrigues@inria.fr) or [Alexandre](mailto:alexandre.wendling@grenoble-inp.org), depending on which TP group you are in.

#### -- Concerning the final exam
The final exam will be a 3h practical evaluation on the computers from ENSIMAG. It will have some multiple-choice questions to evaluate your theoretical knowledge and some practical questions similar to what you will do in the TPs. You will not have access to any internet connections, but you can bring your own handwritten notes, books, printed slides, etc. In the computer that you will use, we will provide you a folder with the instructions for the exam, the `rmd` files to fill with your answers and code, as well as the textbooks of the course.
