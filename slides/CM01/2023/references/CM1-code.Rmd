## Multiple linear regression

We consider the `Advertising` dataset available [[here]](https://www.statlearning.com/s/Advertising.csv).

To load the dataframe we do
```{r}
Advertising <- read.csv('./Advertising.csv', header=TRUE)[, 2:5]
```

and then we can run the multiple linear regression with all of the predictors
```{r}
mylm <- lm(sales ~ ., data=Advertising)
summary(mylm)
```

We could also consider just one predictor in the regression as in
```{r}
mylm1 <- lm(sales ~ newspaper, data=Advertising)
summary(mylm1)
```

The correlation matrix between the predictors can be obtained with
```{r}
cor(Advertising)
```
